# DangerCrypt

A work in progress.

Encryption schemes that are based on good ones, but with **very bad settings**, and **super sketchy implementations**. Created as 1) learning exercise and 2) an obfuscator so a few bits can be converted into a short/readable slug, but where they're *kinda* hidden and appear random.

This should **never** be used to secure anything, just as a learning tool about how some crypto works and the math behind it.
